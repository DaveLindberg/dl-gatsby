SEO is one of the most commonly misunderstood components of online marketing today. Even its title is outdated: SEO encompasses so much more than search engine visibility, it ought to be renamed “UO” for User Optimization, since the qualities that encourage search engines to rank your site are exactly those that make your site accessible and usable. Heck, let’s just call it what it is: “O”.

Long gone are the days of keyword stuffing and gaming the system. At its core, an effective SEO strategy consists of two branches: on-page data, and off-site relationships.

Dialing in on the first is easier: there are specific tactics, tools and development processes which meet the industry’s quality specs. These range from simple (title tags) to involved (keyword optimized content, site speed). Generally, the Pareto Principle is worth following here: implement tactics which provide the greatest return first, then follow up with additional optimizations as needed. Although it’s more efficient to introduce these elements earlier in the development process than it is to retrofit after the fact, it’s also true that starting the process now can indeed produce verifiable results quickly.

The second branch, managing off-site relationships, requires long-term planning and consistent execution. While nurturing strategic linked content takes time and effort, it pays off twice: your market receives greater brand exposure in relevant online media, while search engines obtain direct signals regarding your site’s authority in its field. The technical description for this effect is known as “win/win”. 🙂

Getting SEO right requires the dedication of people across the team. Product managers, content producers, and developers all have a major impact. That’s why it’s so important to get the right tools in place and support each person in the mix.
